This leads to increased absorption and storage of solar radiation, contributing significantly to elevated land surface temperatures and the UHI effect.}

The method is based on using one or two pairs of concurrent Landsat and MODIS data along with one MODIS observation at the prediction date. For each pixel to be predicted, the algorithm selects similar neighboring pixels from the Landsat scene by comparing the MODIS data at the base and prediction dates. The Landsat reflectances of these similar neighboring pixels at the base date are then weighted according to their spectral and spatial similarity to the central pixel to produce the predicted surface reflectance. The algorithm has been tested using data from the NASA LBA (Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia) study area. Results show that STARFM can accurately predict surface reflectance, capturing both spatial and temporal variability, provided that suitable concurrent Landsat and MODIS data are available.}
